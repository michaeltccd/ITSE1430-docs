= Nullable Reference Types

:toc:

This is a new features starting in C# 8. `null` causes problems when both compiling and running code. By default reference types can be `null` but value types cannot. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types[Nullable reference types], when enabled, enforces the same rules for both value and reference types. Reference types no longer support `null`. Of course this is a breaking change and is therefore an opt in only feature. 

Further discussion of this topic can be read in the online documentation.
