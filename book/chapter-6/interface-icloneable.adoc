= ICloneable Interface

The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icloneable[ICloneable] interface is one of the older interfaces in .NET.
It was provided to allow copying (cloning) an object.
There are many times in code where a copy of an object is needed.
For value types simple assignment works but for reference types it does not.
Copying a value requires an understand of the underlying data stored in a type and therefore cannot be auto-generated.

== Using the Interface

The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icloneable[ICloneable] interface exposes a single method https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icloneable.clone[Clone] to clone an object.

.Cloning an Object
[source,csharp]
----
T Clone<T> ( T value ) where T: ICloneable
{   
   return (T)value?.Clone();
}
----

The method makes a copy of the given value.

== Implementing the Interface

Implementing the method is generally straightforward.

- Create a new instance of the type.
- Copy the field values from the source to the target instance.

.Implementing Clone
[source,csharp]
----
public class Rectangle : ICloneable
{
   public int Width { get; set; }
   public int Height { get; set; }

   public object Clone ()
   {
      return new Rectangle() { Width = Width, Height = Height };
   }
}
----

== Interface Issues

There are several issues with this interface.

=== Shallow vs Deep Copy

The first issue is that it is unclear whether a clone is a shallow or deep copy.

Deep Copy::
   Copying the entire object including copying any child objects.
Shallow Copy::
   Copying the primitive fields but using the same reference child objects.

It is up to the implementation to decided. 
Because this is very important to how the interface may be used it almost makes the interface useless.

For example an application may want to implement an undo feature by keeping a copy of an object prior to making some changes.
If the changes are undone later then the copy made before the changes can be used instead of the, now modified, object.
But if that object has child objects then a shallow copy would have had both the original and modified instances using the same object resulting in potential issues.

Note that it is also incorrect to always implement deep copy because this can be expensive and code may assume that the child objects are the same, such as a shared graphics object.

=== Type Safety

The second issue with this interface is that it was added before generics were supported so irrelevant of the type there is always a typecast to convert the copied object from `object` back to the desired type.

For value types this involves boxing which is expensive.

== Modern Cloning Interface

To resolve both of these issues many libraries define a generic interface that supports shallow vs deep copy.

.Modern Cloning Interface
[source,csharp]
----
public interface ICloneable<T> : ICloneable
{
   T Clone ( bool deepCopy );
}
----

This interface allows the caller to determine whether a deep or shallow copy is needed. 
Furthermore it returns the strongly typed result eliminating a type cast.

NOTE: This is not provided by the .NET Framework at this time.

In theory this solves the problems of the original interface but it introduces some potential problems of its own.

- What if a child object does not support shallow or deep cloning?
- What if this interface is defined on a base type and called on a derived type?

There are no easy answers to these questions.
Sometimes the interface documentation specifies the restrictions on its usage and leave it up to the callers and implementors to enforce.
