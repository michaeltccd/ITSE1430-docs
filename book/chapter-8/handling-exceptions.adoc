= Handling Exceptions

It is important for applications to handle errors that they can recover from. This provides a better user experience and allows for applications to be more resilient to unexpected errors. C# provides the link:try-catch.adoc[try-catch] block to support error handling.

NOTE: Refer to link:throwing-exceptions.adoc[Throwing Exceptions] for more information on how exception handlers are located.

== When to Handle Errors

Handling exceptions is important for the following reasons.

- Attempting to recover from errors that are intermittent (e.g. network outages).
- Reporting user errors so the user can take corrective action (e.g. attempting to open a file that does not exist).
- Attempting an alternative approach when a primary solution does not work (e.g. falling back to a central location when a cached copy of data is not available).

At the same time there are many cases where errors should not be handled.
While it is often not good for an application to just crash it does provide important information to the user and the developer.
In some cases crashing is safer than allowing the code to continue.
Some examples of when error should be allowed to crash the program.

- Errors that would cause corruption of data if the program continues.
- Errors that would allow a user to have more access to data than they should normally get.
- Errors that cannot be recovered from (e.g. attempting to write to a non-existent drive).

Refer to the section link:try-catch.adoc[Try-Catch] for the syntax of handling exceptions.

== Handling Exceptions

To handle an exception wrap the code in a link:try-catch.adoc[Try-Catch] block.

.Using a Try-Catch
[source,csharp]
----
try
{
   UpdateDatabase();
} catch (Exception e)
{
   DisplayError(e.Message);
};
----

Only the code inside the `try` block is protected. If any errors occur then the remainder of the code in the `try` block is skipped and the code in the `catch` block is executed. After the `catch` block executes then the code after the `try-catch` runs. The code in the `try` block will not resume execution. Therefore it is important to limit how much code is inside the `try` block.

If multiple `catch` blocks are defined then the runtime evaluates them top down.
Only a single `catch` block will execute.

=== Looking For an Exception Handler

When an exception is thrown the runtime temporarily suspends the current function.
The exception is known as a "first-chance exception" because this is the first chance code has to handle it.

NOTE: If a debugger is attached it gets notified of the exception. Depending upon the debugger settings the debugger may pause the code and notify the user or it may let the runtime continue exception handling.

The runtime begins the process of looking for an exception handler, a `catch` block, that can handle the exception.
The runtime first looks to see if the called code is in a `try` block.
If it is then then the runtime moves to the defined `catch` blocks looking for the first block that can handle the exception.

If no `catch` block can be found in the current function or if the current function has not wrapped the call in a `try` block then the runtime moves back to the calling function.
The runtime keeps walking the stack backwards until it finds a matching `catch` block, if any.

.Walking the Stack
[source,csharp]
----
void A ()
{
   try
   {
      B()
   } catch (InvalidOperationException e)
   {};
}

void B ()
{
   C();
}

void C ()
{
   try
   {
      D();   
   } catch (ArgumentException e)
   {};
}

void D()
{
   //throw new InvalidOperationException();
   //throw new ArgumentException();
}
----

If the above example, if `D` throws an `InvalidOperationException` then the runtime does the following:

. No `try` block in `D` so move back to `C`
. `C` has wrapped the call in a `try` so look for a `catch` block that handles `InvalidOperationException`
. `C` has no matching `catch` block so move back to `B`
. `B` has no `try` block so move back to `A`
. `A` has a `try` block so look for a matching `catch` block that handles `InvalidOperationException`
. `A` has a `catch` block so unwind the stack to `A`
. Resume execution in the `catch` block of `A`

However if `D` throws an `ArgumentException` then the flow is a little different.

. No `try` block in `D` so move back to `C`
. `C` has wrapped the call in a `try` so look for a `catch` block that handles `InvalidOperationException`
. `C` has a `catch` block so unwind the stack to `C`
. Resume execution in the `catch` block of `C`

=== Unwinding the Stack

Once the runtime has found a handler it unwinds the stack.
Unwinding the stack causes the runtime to pop off all the function calls back to the function containing the handler to be called.
All local variables are removed and any link:try-finally.adoc[finally] statements are executed.
This is equivalent to if the function had returned normally.

Once the stack is unwound then the runtime executes the appropriate `catch` block.

== Unhandled Exceptions

If the runtime fails to find a handler for an exception then it becomes an unhandled exception. 
Unhandled exceptions cause a runtime error that crashes the program.
If a debugger is attached it will break into the code and alter the user.
This is known as a "second chance exception". 
This is the second, and last, chance to handle the exception although in almost all cases it is fatal.

== Rethrowing an Exception

Sometimes while handling an exception an application determines that it cannot handle the exception. As far as the runtime is concerned, once a `catch` block starts executing, the exception is handled.
To notify the runtime that the exception is not handled rethrow the exception inside the `catch` block.
To rethrow the exception use the link:throwing-exceptions.adoc[throw] statement without an expression.
The runtime will start looking for a handler again without modifying the original exception that was thrown.

.Rethrowing an Exception
[source,csharp]
----
try
{
   //Do something
} catch (Exception e)
{
    //Log an error

    //Rethrow the exception
    throw;
};
----

Rethrowing an exception effectively hides the original `catch` block.
There is no way to know that another handler has already run.

CAUTION: Never rethrow an exception by passing the exception object as the expression for the `throw` statement.

== Wrapping an Exception

If an exception is thrown while handling an exception in a `catch` block then the original exception is lost.
As far as the runtime is concerned this is a brand new exception and the process starts all over again.

In most cases a handler would not do this but on occassion it is useful to wrap a more specific exception with a more generic one.
This is most common when using derived types that may return implementation-specific exceptions.
Wrapping an exception allows the calling code to have better control over what exceptions are thrown.

To wrap an exception create a new exception and then throw it inside the `catch` block.

.Wrapping an Exception
[source,csharp]
----
try
{
   UpdateDatabase();
} catch (Exception e)
{
   //Wrap an exception
   throw new InvalidOperationException(e);
};
----

Because throwing an exception inside a `catch` block loses the original exception it is generally better to pass the original exception as the "inner exception" to the new exception.
All the existing exception types have a constructor overload that accepts the original exception.
This information is available to calling code but does not directly impact how the exception is handled.
The inner exception is mainly used to provide diagnostic information for a developer to understand what went wrong.

== Unhandleable Exceptions

There are a couple of system exception that cannot be properly handled. 
While it may be possible to use them in a `catch` block the exceptions are always considered fatal and will crash the program irrelevant of what a `catch` block does.

The following are a few of the known exceptions in this category.
