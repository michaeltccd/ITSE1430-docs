Before any database work can be done a connection must be made. Each database has its own .NET provider that provides the necessary infrastructure to talk to the database. Refer to link:providers.adoc[Database Providers] for more information on how providers work. 

Each provider contains a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.common.dbconnection[DbConnection]-derived type to connect to a database. This is the entry point to the database.

## Connection Strings

To connect to a database a connection string is needed. A connection string provides the following information.

- Server hosting the database
- Database to connect to
- Credentials to use for authentication
- Options to use for connecting and reading data

### Connection String Format

Each database provider may use different settings but almost all of them follow a similar style. Connection strings consist of key-value pairs separated by semicolons. Each key-value pair consists of a key followed by a value separated by an equal sign.

.Connection String Syntax
[source,text]
----
key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value;...
----

Case does not matter and spacing between punctation is not relevant. Each key must be recognized by the provider and may contain spaces. Often multiple keys map to the same value so either key can be used. Each key has a value that is interpreted by the provider. Here are some of the common keys used.

.Common Connection String Keys
|===
| Key | Description
| `Server` | Server name
| `Data Source` | Alternative key for server name
| `Database` | Database name
| `Initial Catalog` | Alternative key for database name
| `Integrated Security` | `SSPI` or `true` to use current user for authentication
| `UserName` | User name to authentication
| `User ID` | Alternative key for user name
| `Password` | Password for authentication
|===

.SQL Connection String
[source,text]
----
//Connect to a SQL server database 'Movies' running on server 'dbserver1' using current user credentials
Server=dbserver1;Database=Movies;Integrated Security=SSPI
----

### Acquiring a Connection String

Connection strings are configuration data. Therefore a connection string should not be hard coded in an application. The recommended approach is to store the connection string in an external, secure location such as a key vault, application-specific data store or configuration file. This allows the connection string to be changed without recompiling the code. 

#### .NET Framework

For a .NET framework application the connection string is generally stored in the config file for the application.

.Configuration File Connection String
[source,xml]
----
<connectionStrings>
   <add name="ConnectionName" connectionString="connection string" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
----

The `name` attribute is how the connection string is located at runtime. The `connectionString` contains the connection string. The `providerName` identifies the database provider associated with the string. This is generally the namespace of the database provider.

CAUTION: XML is case sensitive. Ensure the case exactly matches what is required. Every starting XML element (<>) requires a corresponding end element (</>).

To get the connection string you must use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager[ConfigurationManager] class which requires referencing the `System.Configuration` namespace.

.Reading Connection String from Configuration File
[source,csharp]
----
var connStringObject = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionName"];

var connString = connStringObject.ConnectionString;
----

The value used here must match the `name` attribute in the config file.

#### .NET Core

For a .NET Core application the `appsettings.json` file is used for a similar purpose.

.Appsettings.json File
[source,json]
----
{
   "connectionStrings": [
      "ConnectionName": "connectionString"
   ]
}
----

To read the value use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration.configurationextensions.getconnectionstring[GetConnectionString] method on `Configuration`.

.Reading Connection String from appsettings.json
[source,csharp]
----
var connString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("ConnectionName");
----

## Creating a Connection

Once a connection string is available creating a connection simply requires creating an instance of the provider-specific connection type. The default for providers is to use the database provider name with the `-Connection` suffix. Here are some examples.

.Connection Types by Provider
|===
| Provider | Connection Type 
| Sql Server | `SqlConnection`
| Oracle | `OracleConnection`
| MySql | `MySqlConnection`
| Sqlite | `SqliteConnection`
|===

NOTE: Only SQL Server is shipped as part of the .NET Framework. Other providers must be added as a dependency.

.Creating a Connection
[source,csharp]
----
using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{      
};
----

Connections implement https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable[IDisposable] and therefore must be cleaned up. Failure to do so will leak database resources.

Creating the connection does not open a connection to the database. To open the database connection, which triggers a validation of the connection string, call the `Open` method.

.Creating and Open Connection
[source,csharp]
----
using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{      
   conn.Open();
};
----

It is generally better to open the connection just before it is needed to avoid wasting a connection.
