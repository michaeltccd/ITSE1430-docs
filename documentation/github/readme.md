This course requires that you use [GitHub](https://github.com) for your class and lab work. Lab assignments are accepted only through GitHub and all class work will be available from GitHub. 

To set up GitHub on your local machine refer to the [Setup](setup/readme.md) instructions. We will also go over this in class the first week.

To learn the basics of Git refer to the [Getting Started](getting-started/readme.md) documentation. Be sure to pay careful attention to the instructions for getting Git configured initially and for the process you need to follow each time you come to class and at home. 

The general process will be.

1. Set up Git.
1. Use the class repository as a template to create your own repository for the semester (e.g. `itse1430`).

Each time you sit down at the computer you'll need to repeat the following.

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Sync your own class repository.
