# Setting Up GitHub

This class uses [Github](https://github.com) for storing all class work and for submitting labs. You must setup a repository in order to complete the work in this class.

## Creating a Profile

If you do not yet have a Github account associated with your MyTccd email then do the following.

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com).
2. Enter a username (ex. Mynametccd). Note that the user name is generally part of the URL you will share so use a generic user name.
3. Enter your MyTccd email address.
4. Enter a password.
5. Click `Sign up for GitHub`.

## Creating Your Class Repository

You need a repository to work with Github. A repository is a collection of files. For this class you will have a repository for the work we do during the semester. Both your in class work and lab assignments will be placed here.

Normally to use a repository you need to either create a new repository (if this is brand new) or [clone](getting-started) an existing repository (if you're starting with someone else's code). However we will use a template repository instead. 

To use the existing class repository as a template do the following.

1. Make sure you are logged into Github with your TCCD profile.
1. Go to the class repository (URL will be provided in class).
1. You should see an option to `Use this template` at the top of the repository just before the list of files.
1. Click the `Use this template` button.
1. Enter the repository name (use `itse1430` or similar).
1. Enter an optional description such as `ITSE 1430 Programming in C#`).
1. Click the create button to create the repository and copy the contents to your own repository.

After the repository has been set up you do not need to do anything else. You now have your own copy of the class repository.
