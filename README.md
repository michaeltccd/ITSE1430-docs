# ITSE 1430 - Introduction to C# Programming

Course material for this class.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin note the following prerequisites for your environment.

1.	Windows  7 SP1 or higher or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or higher 
2.	1.8 Ghz or faster processor (dual core or higher strongly recommended)
3.	2 GB memory (4 GB or more strongly recommended)
4.	10+ GB hard drive space
5.	Fast internet connection for downloading software
6.	Additional requirements may be found here. Note that older operating systems may require additional Windows updates to be installed.

*Note: Mac, Linux and Android are not supported operating systems. These platforms are not supported and no assistance can be given if you choose to use them. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac currently do not support the necessary project types used by the course. You may be able to them however most of the tools discussed below will not work and no support can be given for its use. You are responsible for ensuring any labs completed using other version of Visual Studio work correctly in VS 2017 as well.*

If you are unable to meet the above requirements then you will need to use the Computer Lab available on campus.

## Class Repository 

This repository is for documentation only. You do not need to clone this repository. It is available only to provide some documentation. The class repository will be provided in class and contains the work that you will want to sync with throughout the sememster.

- `documentation` is where the core documentation for setting up your machine and learning to work with Visual Studio and Github are at. The repository readme files link to this documentation directly.
- `lessons` is where a list of topics are stored related to stuff we are studying. Eventually it will evolve into detailed documentation or links but for now it is just links to additional information.
