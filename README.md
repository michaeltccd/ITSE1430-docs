*Note: Mac, Linux and Android are not supported operating systems. These platforms are not supported and no assistance can be given if you choose to use them. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac currently do not support the necessary project types used by the course. You may be able to them however most of the tools discussed below will not work and no support can be given for its use. You are responsible for ensuring any labs completed using other version of Visual Studio work correctly in VS 2017 as well.*
